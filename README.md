# Memory Game Project

This project is a memory game where players need to match pairs of cards. The objective is to find all the matching pairs by flipping over cards and remembering their positions.

## Description

The Memory Game is a classic concentration game that tests a player's memory and cognitive skills. The game consists of a grid of cards that are initially faced down. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time to find matching pairs. If a pair is found, the cards remain face up. If not, the cards are flipped back over, and the player tries again. The game continues until all pairs are successfully matched.
This implementation of the Memory Game includes the ability to choose different game themes. Each theme represents a different set of images used on the cards. The images are fetched from an API to provide a variety of options for players to enjoy different themes and visual styles.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Used for creating the structure of the web page and defining the necessary tags.
- CSS: Used for styling and visual presentation of the web page with graphical designs.
- JavaScript: Used for implementing the game logic, handling user events, and dynamically updating the game interface.
- API: Utilized to fetch images for the game themes and provide a diverse range of card designs.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. On the main page, click on one of the game options to start playing.
3. In the game interface, flip over two cards by clicking on them. If the cards match, they will remain face up. If not, they will flip back over.
4. Continue flipping cards and trying to find all the matching pairs.
5. The game ends when all pairs are successfully matched.
6. The player's score, such as the number of attempts or elapsed time, can be displayed as per the game's implementation.
